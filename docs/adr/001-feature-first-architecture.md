# ADR-001: Feature-First Clean Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a scalable architecture that supports team collaboration, maintains code quality, and allows for independent feature development.

## Decision
We will use a Feature-First Clean Architecture approach where:
- Each feature is a self-contained module
- Features follow clean architecture layers (domain, data, presentation)
- Dependencies are injected using GetIt
- State management uses BLoC pattern

## Consequences
### Positive
- Features can be developed independently
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test individual features
- Scalable for large teams

### Negative
- Initial setup complexity
- More boilerplate code
- Learning curve for new developers
