# Onboarding Feature Migration Tracker

This document tracks the migration status of components in the onboarding feature.

## Migration Status

### Common Components
- [x] `base_onboarding_step.dart` - Keep (Foundation for new architecture)
- [x] `onboarding_migration_helper.dart` - Keep (Adapter for old/new implementations)
- [x] `onboarding_navigation_buttons.dart` - Keep (Reusable UI component)
- [x] `onboarding_progress_indicator.dart` - Keep (Reusable UI component)
- [x] `onboarding_step_factory.dart` - Keep (Factory for step creation)
- [x] `onboarding_step_header.dart` - Keep (Reusable UI component)
- [x] `onboarding_step_manager.dart` - Keep (Manager for step navigation)
- [x] `index.dart` - Keep (Exports all common components)

### Step Implementations
- [x] `birth_country/birth_country_step.dart` - Keep (New implementation)
- [x] `current_status/current_status_step.dart` - Keep (New implementation)
- [x] `migration_journey/migration_journey_step.dart` - Keep (New implementation)
- [x] `index.dart` - Keep (Exports all step implementations)

### Widget Adapters
- [x] `birth_country/birth_country_step_widget.dart` - Keep (Adapter for old implementation)
- [x] `current_status/current_status_step_widget.dart` - Keep (Adapter for old implementation)
- [x] `migration_journey/migration_journey_step_widget.dart` - Keep (Adapter for old implementation)
- [x] `migration_journey/migration_step_modal.dart` - Keep (Shared component)
- [x] `migration_journey/migration_timeline_widget.dart` - Keep (Shared component)
- [x] `country_selector.dart` - Keep (Shared component)
- [x] `visa_selector.dart` - Keep (Shared component)

### Screens

- [ ] `onboarding_screen_new.dart` - Remove (Redundant implementation)

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1: Parallel Implementation (Completed)**
   - [x] Create common components
   - [x] Implement step-specific components
   - [x] Create adapter components
   - [x] Update onboarding screen

2. **Phase 2: Gradual Migration (Current)**
   - [x] Migrate birth country step - Using BirthCountryStepWidget adapter
   - [x] Migrate current status step - Using CurrentStatusStepWidget adapter
   - [x] Migrate migration journey step - Using MigrationJourneyStepWidget adapter
   - [x] Update references in onboarding_screen.dart

3. **Phase 3: Clean Up (Completed)**
   - [x] Remove redundant files - Removed onboarding_screen_new.dart
   - [x] Update documentation - Updated README.md with usage examples
   - [x] Finalize feature-first implementation - Ensured clean architecture principles
